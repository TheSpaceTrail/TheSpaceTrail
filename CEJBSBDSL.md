# CEJBSBDSL
*We were so pre-occupied with whether or not we could, we never stopped to think if we should.*

CEJBSBDSL (Pronounced "See-Jizz-Bull") is a mistake. 
May the Code Efficent JSON-Based Story-Boarding Domain Specific language serve as a harrowing example for any aspiring programmer. Never make new infrastructure when it was made for you and can meet your needs.
We *already* had a lightweight scripting language to write our game in; Python! We should have just used Python and added some functions.
Instead, we chose to invent a DSL specifically for this game, we spent so much time making this language, all encompasing, expandable and flexible when we could have just made a few functions in Python.

To learn to use the language read [CEJBSBDSL.spec.md](CEJBSBDSL.spec.md). You are free to make your own projects in it! Although I would not wish that on my worst enemy.

If you want to look at some beatiful syntax sugar take a look at our modified implementation for our game [here](https://github.com/TheSpaceTrail/TheSpaceTrail/src_tst/storyline.json) (*because our language is so deeply terrible, we had to write a modified shim for the parser so that we could add functionality, so you need to run it through the parser file).

The entire CEJBSBDSL language can be accessed in [CEJBSBDSL.py](/CEJBSBDSL.py).
```
python CEJBSBDSL.py --file script.json --entry-point "run"
```

Example:

`demo.json`
```json
{
    "demo": [
        "Hello, World!",
        "!end"
    ]
}
```

```
> python CEJBSBDSL.py --file .\src_tst\demo.json --entry-point "demo"
Hello, World!
```

Help:
```
> python CEJBSBDSL.py --help
usage: CEJBSBDSL.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-e ENTRY_POINT] [-s SEED] [-v]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --file FILE       path to script
  -e, --entry-point ENTRY_POINT
                        program entry point (default: "init")
  -s, --seed SEED       random seed (default: 42)
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```
